    "This is a compact from of the Confusion matrix tool notebook, it runs in one cell or can be run on Raijin. It is designed to be pointed at a file with all of the DLCD tif and re-run with different year inputs by changing one variable:  the 'year_in' which should be the first year of the 2 year span of each DLCD map. \n",

    "as a result, this notebook dosn't have any images, however they can be easily generated from the xarrays found within. To run this notebook you will need acess to the DLCD itterations in the form of geotifs. The out put is a confusion matrix in CSV file format. \n",

    "In the output CSV file the landcover types for the old itteration are along the X axis, (across the top of the file in the first row) the landcover types for the new itteration run down the Y axis (in the first collum of the file) ie:\n",
